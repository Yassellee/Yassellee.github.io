Hi! I am Yuxuan Li, currently completing my senior year in Computer Science and Technology at Tsinghua University. Here are my [CV](https://yassellee.github.io/CV_YuxuanLi.pdf) and [Publications](https://yassellee.github.io/publications/).

My research interest spans the wide field of human-computer interaction. I believe that with a deep understanding of both humans and technology, they can enhance the capabilities of one another.

Open to collaborations and discussions! If you're interested in working with me or have intriguing ideas you'd like to share, don't hesitate to reach out. You can contact me at my [university email address](mailto:yuxuan-l20@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn) or on my [gmail](mailto:yuxuanli011225@gmail.com).
