Hi! I am Yuxuan Li, currently completing my senior year in Computer Science and Technology at Tsinghua University. Here are my [CV](https://yassellee.github.io/CV_YuxuanLi.pdf) and [Publications](https://yassellee.github.io/publications/).

My research interest spans the wide field of human-computer interaction. I believe that with a deep understanding of both humans and technology, they can enhance the capabilities of one another.

I am open for any collaboration! If you want to collabotate with me or just have some ideas to share with me, feel free to email me at my [edu email address](yuxuan-l20@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn) or my [gmail address](yuxuanli011225@gamil.com).
