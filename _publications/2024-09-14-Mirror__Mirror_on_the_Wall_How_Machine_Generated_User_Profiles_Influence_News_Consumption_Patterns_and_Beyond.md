Advanced machine learning algorithms and the intricacies of the human brain often emerge as parallels, functioning as enigmatic black boxes that provoke both curiosity and caution. While discourse frequently revolves around our perceptions of machine learning, the manner in which these algorithms interpret human behavior, especially in a human-understandable format, remains underexplored. This study delves into this realm by employing a large language model to generate descriptive, human-interpretable user profiles based on individuals' news preferences. Participants were divided into two groups: a treatment group, which received user profiles after expressing their news preferences, and a control group, which received no profiles. We argue that these generated profiles act as reflective "mirrors" of user behavior. Subsequently, participants' news consumption patterns were observed in a second round to discern behavioral changes post-profile revelation. By juxtaposing data from both rounds and comparing the two groups, we evaluated changes in various news consumption metrics.
